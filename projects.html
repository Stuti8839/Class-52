        <p>I have designed many games during my programming journey at Whitehat Junior, like the pong game, the Trex Game, tthe angry birds game, the car racing game, and finally the polar bear game (many of these are linked on my portfolio page). These games are all made using different platforms like code.org, p5 editor and VS studio code. The difficulty of creating the games gradually increased, with the pong game teaching me the most basic aspects of JavaScript, while the car racing game was the most difficut to create since it used aspects like a realtime database. The polar bear game was the culmination of all that I have learned so far, with it being my submission to the Silicon Valley Challenge.</p>
